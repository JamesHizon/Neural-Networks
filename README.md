# Neural Networks
This repository will include all neural network projects that I am going to work on via Udemy.

Given that my labtop is currently being fixed, and the online compiler from jupyter notebook does not have keras,
for example, I will simply upload my code. In the future, it will show outputs.

I would like to give credit where credit is due.
Thus, these resources have been extremely helpful in teaching me how to write code for ML/DL projects:

Udemy: Applied Machine Learning for Healthcare
Udemy: PyTorch for Deep Learning with Python Bootcamp.

Expect more projects to be uploaded in the future.

# Heart Disease Prediction

Constructed neural network to train and test data of patients that have heart disease.
Observed different levels of heart disease, and decided to separate into just two categories:
Instead of :
1) Not having heart disease
2) Low levels of HD
3) Med levels
4) High levels

We worked with binary classification to train data:

1) Not having heart disease
2) Has heart disease.

By working with this, we observed an increase in the accuracy of our model for predictions.

# Neural Network (Binary Classification for Color Determination)

Created a neural network that classifies whether a flower is red or blue.
It will always be a random number. We also randomly generated phrases to go along with determining if a flower is red or blue.
