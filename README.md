# Neural-Networks
This repository will include all neural network projects that I am going to work on via Udemy.

Given that my labtop is currently being fixed, and the online compiler from jupyter notebook does not have keras,
for example, I will simply upload my code. In the future, it will show outputs.

I would like to give credit where credit is due.
Thus, these resources have been extremely helpful in teaching me how to write code for ML/DL projects:

Udemy: Applied Machine Learning for Healthcare
Udemy: PyTorch for Deep Learning with Python Bootcamp.

Expect more projects to be uploaded in the future.
